        <h1>ECE 140A: My Week 2 Entrepreneurial Blog</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Nicholas Kading, and I am a third year student at UCSD.
            My major is electrical engineering and I have a particular interest
            in computer system design. Starting in middle school, and ramping
            up in high school, I was programming in my free time as a hobby.
            While I have not had much formal experience up to this point, I have
            delved deep in a plethora of programming languages and found myself
            capable of thinking in such a way that is useful in programming.</p>
        <h2>ECE 140A: Summary of Week 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually ideas get shut down before you even get to writing a single line of code.</li>
            <li>Routing is like a switchboard operator</li>
            <li>Planned Obsolescence - Companies that are aware that they will get replaced survive</li>
            <li>Product market fit determines whether the business crosses the chasm.</li>
            <li>The end-goal for businesses heavily determines the decisions the company makes in the present moment (Whether the company is made to last, or if it is looking to get bought)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Product Thinking Vocabulary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum Viable Product - It is the smallest possible iterative experiment</li>
            <li>RIBS Test (Relevant Inevitable Believable Sustainable/Scalable) - It is a way of testing whether a product may succeed. It evaluates it on such criteria.</li>
            <li>Vitamin vs Painkiller - A vitamin is something supplemental that improves the quality of life of a customer. A painkiller is a solution to a problem, where that problem causes anguish to a customer.</li>
