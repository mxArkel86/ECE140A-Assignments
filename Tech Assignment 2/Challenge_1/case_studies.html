    <p>The product is a gaming mouse which means that it has a high level of
        accuracy and responsiveness. The product is made of plastic and has all
        the typical buttons of a mouse with additional buttons on the side. There
        is a high level of software customizability, for factors such as adjusting
        the polling rate, the sensitivity, or the RGB of the mouse.</p>

    <h2>My Evaluation</h2>
    <p>I would definitely recommend this mouse. This is because for the right audience, which is usually those who play competitive
        video games, the high dpi factor, the fact that the mouse is wired instead of wireless, and the high customizability of the
        mouse in regard to the amount of buttons it has makes it ideal for this kind of customer. Especially for those with larger hands,
        the larger size of the G502 hero is a plus. It has been used extensively and has been in the market for a while, and this time
        has shown its reliability and favorability among customers. With the price point of $80, the longevity of this product, and the
        quality of the product, I would recommend it.</p>
