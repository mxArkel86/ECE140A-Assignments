        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>Who I am:</h2>
            <p>I am a third-year student at UCSD. I study Electrical Engineering, specifically Computer System Design.
                Despite being an Electrical Engineer, I have a particular interest in programming.</p>
            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>I was born in Florida, though for most of my life, I have lived in San Diego. In High School, I took an engineering course that covered many different topics, such as 3D modeling, product
            development, tension and trusses, and electrical wiring. What I found most interesting was the electrical stuff
                 that we did, which was one of the reasons for ECE being my major of choice.</p>
            <h2>Goals:</h2>
            <p>My goal overall is to grow as a person, and to have fun while doing it. Part of growing as a person is studying
                 at UCSD and becoming more knowledgeable. When looking for a job after UCSD, I hope to find a job
                 that makes me excited to go to work, meeting likeminded coworkers and working in a friendly environment.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Linux/Exploring OSs</li>
                <li>Game Emulation</li>
                <li>Outside Activities (biking, running, hiking, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Projects:</h2>
            <h3 style="color: purple">OneDrive Fetch</h3>
            <p>OneDrive Fetch was a passion project that I built, and that I am currently building. It has been in the works for a month. Its
            purpose is to synchonize changes between onedrive and a local copy of the files. My personal experience with OneDrive has included video files becoming corrupted.
                The OneDrive Fetch application is meant to compare hashes between the copies and notify me as to what version I would prefer to keep.</p>
            <h3 style="color: darkgreen; ">Sidescroller</h3>
            <p>Sidescroller is a game that I developed a while ago that took me approximately two months of on and off work. The most impressive part of the game
            was the creation of depth with the objects in the scene. A lot of experimentation went into developing the algorithm to place the images on the screen
            at the right place. Collision was also figured out, though it was not fullproof. A level editor was also created, that made modifying the level easy, and
            a built-in console allowed changing game settings on-the-fly.</p>
